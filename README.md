# NBA-Regular-Season-Statistical-Analysis
### Project Description
This project is a statistical analysis of NBA team stats from the 01 - 24 seasons. I will be using a supervised learning technique to determine which stats influence winning in the regular season. This is a capstone project to finish my degree program.
### Environment(s)
Jupyter Notebook
Tableau
### Language(s)
Python
### Packages and Libraries
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
sklearn
### Competencies
1. Data Analysis and Interpretation: I'll showcase my ability to analyze large datasets and interpret statistical data to draw conclusions about winning trends in NBA regular seasons.
2. Programming Proficiency: Using Python for data manipulation and analysis, particularly with libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and sklearn.
3. Machine Learning: Application of Lasso Regression to build a predictive model that identifies which statistics significantly impact game outcomes, demonstrating my skills in applying machine learning techniques.
4. Data Visualization: Using both Python libraries and Tableau to create compelling visualizations that communicate my findings effectively.
5. Statistical Modeling: My use of statistical analysis and regression models to test hypotheses and explore data relationships.
6. Critical Thinking and Problem Solving: Throughout the project, from hypothesis formulation to data analysis and interpretation, I'll be solving complex problems and making decisions based on data.
7. Project Management: Managing the scope, timeline, and resources of a significant data analytics project, including adherence to a project timeline and meeting deliverables.
8. Research and Documentation: Conducting thorough research and maintaining detailed documentation of my analysis process, which is essential for academic and professional settings.
9. Technical Communication: Ability to communicate technical information effectively to non-technical stakeholders through the use of Tableau and other visualization tools.
